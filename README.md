# Step 1: Setup

Run commands in CLI in order.

1. `git remote add origin https://github.com/imkoodah/outbreak-game.git`
2. `git pull origin master`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run dev`
5. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

If it works perfectly, you can go ahead and move on to step 2.

# Step 2: Making changes

If you want to make changes, you can follow the example below.

1. Navigate to the `app` directory.
2. Open up the directory you wish to make changes to.
3. If you wish to create a new system, create a directory in the `systems` directory.
4. Go ahead and create a `page.tsx` file in that new directory.
5. Follow the same structure as the other files in the parent directory. Example: Follow the same `page.tsx` as the others in the `systems` directory.

After that, submit a PR and it will be reviewed.
